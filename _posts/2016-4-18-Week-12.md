<b>What did you do this past week?</b>

In SWE, we finished looking over some SQL such as aggregation, inserts, updates and deletes. We now moved to a new topic, which was refactoring and designing code. I went to HackDFW all weekend also.

<b>What's in your way?</b>

I need to work on the algorithms assignment and work on the SWE project.

<b>What will you do next week?</b>

I will be working on the algorithms assignment and then finishing the SWE project this week.

<b>Thoughts</b>

Our discussion in class on how to approach refactoring the code was really interesting and something I think is important for students to practice doing. I also had a great time at HackDFW, I managed to get really comfortable with web development while doing the SWE pojects, so it made my project not too much of a challenge to work on. I ended up being very exhausted, but it was an experience that was worth it.

<b>Tip of the Week!</b>

If you want to check out the projects people make at hackathons, check out [DEVPOST](devpost.com). It is an awesome place to find projects you are interested in and help you brainstorm.
