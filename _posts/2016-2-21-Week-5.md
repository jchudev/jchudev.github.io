<b>What did you do this past week?</b>

We learned more about iterables, iterators and generators this week. The Netflix project was also due and me and my partner had to turn that in. Not too much has happened, mostly work on assignments and preparing for the algorithms exam. I also applied to Hack UTD.

<b>What's in your way?</b>

I have to study for the algorithms test. I struggled a little bit understanding some of the recent content, but after reviewing it I feel more comfortable now. I will probably need to decide on who to work with for the upcoming project in SWE as well.

<b>What will you do next week?</b>

I have to take an algorithms exam tomorow. I have some time away from assignments and projects this week, so I'll probably work on my side project.

<b>Thoughts</b>

I really enjoyed class this week in SWE. Iterables, iterators and generators are something I've never seen before. I found them interesting since they seem to be useful. I'm a bit anxious for the upcoming exam in algorithms tomorow, but after that it seems like I'll have an enjoyable couple of weeks coming up.

<b>Tip of the Week!</b>

If you ever have free time on a weekend, participate in a hackathon. It's a great time to network and have fun. Most importantly you can learn new skills in a very short period of time and dive deeper into your interests. You also never know, what an idea will turn into in the future as well.
