title: Week 8

<b>What did you do this past week?</b>

On Monday we went over our next project for SWE. We went over the expectations and the tools. In algorithms, we learned more about dynamic programming, specifically sequence alignment. On Wednesday we learned about using Rackspace from an employee that works there in SWE. In algorithms we learned about shortest path algorithms for negative edge weights. Then on Thursday, I went to the startup crawl and saw the rising companies of Austin.

<b>What's in your way?</b>

This week is Spring break, so I'll take plenty of time to relax. I still have to plan out the SWE project with my group.

<b>What will you do next week?</b>

Spend time with my family for sure. Aside from that, I'll work on the SWE project and work on my own side projects as well. I'll probably attend some SXSW events too.

<b>Thoughts</b>

I had a pretty good week. Learning dynamic programming was awesome because it'll give my a new perspective on how to solve certain problems. I'm also very excited to work ont he SWE project because I've always wanted to work on a web project. The startup crawl also taught me a lot about what the startups look like at the moment in Austin.

<b>Tip of the Week!</b>

Since Parse is shutting down, for my tip this week I'll talk about an alternative. (Firebase)[https://www.firebase.com/] is another backend as a service platform that you can use. It has some awesome advantages as well such as real time data synchronization with applications.
