<b>What did you do this past week?</b>

This week we started looking more into project 1 in class. Along with that, we started looking more into testing and assertions. We firmly established when to use assertions. We also looked into the Python testing framework as well. Outside of class I took time to get everything setup to work on the project repo and on my local directory.

<b>What's in your way?</b>

There was apparrently an issue with Sphere, which may cause issues when testing the correctness of our code. Luckily I'm familiar with this project, since I completed it in C++ last semester. I also have an Algorithms and Complexity homework that's due next week so I'll need to review some old concepts from Discrete math to ensure I complete it correctly.

<b>What will you do next week?</b>

Since project 1 is due Thursday, I definitely plan on finishing it early. I'll also be taking time to do my Algorithms and Complexity homework and make sure it's done correctly. Another thing I will do is review concepts from discrete math to make sure I can do the homework correctly. I will also be attending the FOCS career night and career fair and look into other potential career opportunities.

<b>Thoughts</b>

So far the project is a nice way to get back into the groove of things. It's a simple project that'll make sure I complete the project in the defined process. I'm quite excited to attend the career fair and FOCS career night this semester. I learned a lot in OOP and feel even more comfortable talking to others about coding concepts. To add to that I have C++ on my resume now.

<b>Tip of the Week!</b>

When developing applications, it is probably a good idea to develop on a virtual machine. The applications you develop may not be running on the same platform you're developing on. To add to that, it can ensure that your team can develop on the same platform if the host machines differ.
